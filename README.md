# Tab Notes

A very simple note taking app, which works on your browser, offline and online.

It has cloud sync, for which you can register for FREE (for now, I'm still
deciding how this will work).

It also stores all revisions on each browser every 5 seconds (if a change is
detected) for up to 1MB of storage.
